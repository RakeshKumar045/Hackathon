Welcome to Machine Learning for Banking.


Banks offer various kinds of accounts and provide loans based on 
the requirements. Apart from it, there are other various activities like 
investments in market and different funds. Overall, the banking sector has a 
wide impact on the economy directly and indirectly.


There are many banks across the globe that are leveraging machine learning and
 AI in their daily routine and getting benefits out of it.


For example, top banks in the US like JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, 
City Bank and US banks are already using machine learning to provide various 
facilities to customers as well as for risk prevention and detection. Some of
 the applications include:



The process, defined as ‘risk-based pricing’, uses a sophisticated algorithm 
that leverages different determining factors of a loan applicant. Selection of
 significant factors will help develop a prediction algorithm which can 
 estimate loan interest rates based on clients’ information. On one hand,
 knowing the factors will help consumers and borrowers to increase their 
 credit worthiness and place themselves in a better position to negotiate 
 for getting a lower interest rate. On the other hand, this will help
 lending companies to get an immediate fixed interest rate estimation 
based on clients information. Here, your goal is to use a training dataset
to predict the loan rate category (1 / 2 / 3) that will be assigned to 
each loan in our test set.
